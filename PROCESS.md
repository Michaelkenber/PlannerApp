# Process

## 7 june
Today i started working on getting a finished prototype by the end of the day, at which i succeeded.

## 11 june
Today i worked on the base of my app. I started working on a functioning calender and i added the Google Maps api,
to display the map in the map section.

Today i continued working on my calendar. I tried using certain cocaopods suchs as JTAppleCalendarView, but failed to get them to work and decided to do it without them. The Calendar proved to be alot harder than expected, so that is going to be a challenge for the days to come.

I am not quit happy with my daily progress. I am putting in a lot of hours, but the daily progress is not a lot. I have tried to do the calendar in a multiple of different ways, but most of them were to hard, but did cost a lot of time to figure out. Today i decided to make the easiest version of my daily calendar due to time constraints. This version is, sadly, quite visually unappealing, however if i want to finish the rest of the app, i believe i have to make it as simple as possible. 
I have also looked at all the API's to start working on the map and all of its distances and times (also for calculating and optimizing for travel time). What i realised is that i need more different API's from google, than i thought was neccessary at firs. It seems i need 4 different API's from google: Maps SDK, Distance Matrix, Places and Directions API. The challenge of tommorow will be to incorporate them into my app.
