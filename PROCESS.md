to display the map in the map section.

Today i continued working on my calendar. I tried using certain cocaopods suchs as JTAppleCalendarView, but failed to get them to work and decided to do it without them. The Calendar proved to be alot harder than expected, so that is going to be a challenge for the days to come.
