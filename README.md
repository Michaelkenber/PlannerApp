# PlannerApp
I, Michael Berend, herby submit the planner app. 
The planner app holds a calendar for the user with activities. The user can add activities and the planner will calculate the corresponding
travel time from the former activity, given a mode of transport. 

# Visualisations
Below are a couple visualisations of the planner app. More visualisations are provided in REPORT.MD.
